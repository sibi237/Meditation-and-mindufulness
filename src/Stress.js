  What happens to the body during stress?<br/>
  The body’s autonomic nervous system controls your heart rate, breathing, vision changes and more. Its built-in stress response, the “fight-or-flight response,” helps the body face stressful situations.
  
  When a person has long-term (chronic) stress, continued activation of the stress response causes wear and tear on the body. Physical, emotional and behavioral symptoms develop.
  
  Physical symptoms of stress include:
  
  Aches and pains.
  Chest pain or a feeling like your heart is racing.
  Exhaustion or trouble sleeping.

  How is stress diagnosed?<br/>
Stress is subjective — not measurable with tests. Only the person experiencing it can determine whether it's present and how severe it feels. A healthcare provider may use questionnaires to understand your stress and how it affects your life.

If you have chronic stress, your healthcare provider can evaluate symptoms that result from stress. For example, high blood pressure can be diagnosed and treated.

  Meditation is practiced in numerous religious traditions. The earliest records of meditation (dhyana) are found in the Upanishads, and meditation plays an important role in Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism.[5] Since the 19th century, Asian meditative techniques have spread to other cultures where they have also found application in non-spiritual contexts, such as business and health.[6]

Meditation may significantly reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and pain,[7] and enhance peace, perception,[8] self-concept, and well-being.[9][10][11] Research is ongoing to better understand the effects of meditation on health (psychological, neurological, and cardiovascular) and other areas.
