      Finding The Best Meditation Position
First things first. Before finding the best posture for meditation, you need to find the clothing you are most comfortable in. You need to wear something in which your body does not feel restrained. The clothes should allow you to move and stretch your body freely. Avoid tight clothing like jeans, whereas yoga pants, gym shorts, and a cotton t-shirt could be your go-to options.

What are the Different Meditation Positions?
<br/>
We start with the simplest meditation postures and then towards a few technical ones. This will help people who have just begun to meditate and also those who have been meditating for a long time but are still unable to find the best posture for meditation for themselves.

1. Sitting in a chair <br/> One of the easiest meditation positions for beginners or anyone looking to start their pace at meditation. All you have to do is, find a chair and sit in it with your back straight and your feet touching the ground. This is also a suitable meditation posture for people who find it challenging to sit on the floor. While meditating in this posture, you just have to pay attention to the alignment of your spine. It should be straight. You can also use a pillow for more support. This meditation posture strengthens your back muscles and prepares you for more unsupported postures.

       This is a sitting position for meditation that supports your back. It can be done while leaning back against a wall. You can cross your legs or extend them out in front of you, whichever you feel is most comfortable. A cushion or a blanket under you will also help you achieve a comfortable meditation posture. This is one of the sitting meditation positions that builds lower back and aligns your spine.
